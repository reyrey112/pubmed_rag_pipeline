# PubMed RAG Comparison Pipeline

A data engineering and MLOps project that ingests biomedical research papers from PubMed, builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for scientific Q&A, and automates embedding and generation model evaluation and promotion, orchestrated with Apache Airflow on Databricks.

---

## Background

With the large amounts of data in R&D situations, its often hard to find exact papers that relate to your experiments and help you know if you're on track. This project is an exploration of what it could look like being able to query large number sof research papers for data on your topic. Ask a natural language question and get an answer with PubMed research citations:

> **"What factors reduce viscosity in protein formulations?"**
> → Retrieves the most relevant research excerpts → Generates an answer → Cites source papers

## Key Features

### Medallion Architecture
Data flows through medallion architecture, with gold being reserved for future processing and modelling using dbt models for staging, intermediate joins, and analysis-ready marts.

### Automated Model Evaluation + Promotion + Rollback
Two separate evaluation pipelines run on a schedule and automatically promote better-performing models without manual intervention.

**Embedding model evaluation**
- Generates synthetic Q&A pairs from chunks using Gemini
- Scores each candidate model on Hit Rate@5 and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)
- If a better model is found, automatically updates the production config and triggers a full re-embedding + vector index rebuild

**Generation model evaluation**
- Uses Gemini as an LLM judge to score answers on faithfulness, relevance, and conciseness (1–5 each)
- Computes a composite score and promotes the best performer

### Production Config Table with Rollback
All model promotion events write a new versioned row to a `production_config` Delta table (embedding model, generation model, dimensions, and timestamp). The RAG query layer always reads the latest version. Rolling back to any previous configuration is a single function call.

```
config_version | updated_at       | updated_by           | gen_model     | emb_model      | emb_dim
1               | 2026-06-01 10:00 | initial_setup        | flan-t5-base  | MiniLM-L6      | 384
2               | 2026-06-08 03:00 | embedding_promotion  | flan-t5-base  | specter2_base  | 768
3               | 2026-06-08 04:00 | generation_promotion | flan-t5-large | specter2_base  | 768
```

### Airflow DAGs
Four DAGs coordinate the full system:

- **`ingest_and_chunk`** — weekly ingestion → chunking
- **`embed_and_vector`** —  embedding → vector index sync
- **`embedding_model_promotion`** — embedding model evaluation + automated promotion
- **`generation_model_promotion`** — generation model evaluation + automated promotion

## Data Pipeline (Detailed)

### 1. Ingestion
PubMed's E-utilities API is queried for a configurable search term (e.g. "Viral Vectors"). Article metadata and abstracts are written to `bronze.abstracts` and `bronze.pubmed_meta` as managed Delta tables in Unity Catalog.

### 2. Chunking
A Databricks Spark job reads `bronze.abstracts`, splits abstracts into overlapping text chunks using LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` and writes chunk-level records to `silver.chunks`. Uses Pandas UDFs for efficient distributed processing.

### 3. Embedding
A configurable Sentence Transformers model from `production_config` encodes each chunk into a dense vector. Models are cached to a Databricks Volume to avoid re-downloading across runs. Outputs are written to `silver.embeddings` with Change Data Feed enabled for Vector Search sync.

### 4. Vector Search
A Databricks Vector Search endpoint and delta-sync index are created and/or against `silver.embeddings`. The index automatically handles dimension changes when the embedding model is promoted.

### 5. RAG Query
At query time, the question is embedded with the same production model and the vector index returns the top-5 most similar chunks. A generation model produces an answer grounded in those chunks. The Gradio app provides an interactive chat interface.

| `specter2_base` | 768 | - | - |

*Results populated after evaluation runs.*

### Generation Models Compared

## Relevance

This project was designed around real research areas from my background:

- **Pharmaceutical/biotech** — PubMed queries on drug formulations, protein stability, viral vectors, and bioprocessing

The RAG system is to be expanded on and positioned as a practical tool for literature review automation for R&D confirmation and research.
